Welcome to Cherry Framework - the name for genuine simplicity in Java Web development!

 Cherry is a tiny active kernel who's primary role is to glue together the best-of-breed open-source Java libraries for delivering Java Web applications equivalent results-wise to their JEE counterparts but without the JEE bloath.  

 For developing Cherry powered Java Web applications a developer needs hands-on experience with following technologies: 
 * Core
   * Java 7+
   * Dependencies injection Spring or EJB3/CDI style (JBoss Weld)
   * JSON, JAX-RS Spring or EJB3 style controllers (Jackson)
   * Build and packaging  - JAR, ZIP etc. with Maven
 * Extensions
   * MongoDB for persistence of native web data
   * Hazelcast primarly for caching and/or - highly not recommended!, server side stateful data.
